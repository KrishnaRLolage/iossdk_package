 @brief Open the Virtual Assistant, for the specified grammar model.
 
 Open the Virtual Assistant for the specified grammar model. If the SpeechKit session is not open, the application type is not correct, the DMVA state is not valid, or the parameter value is invalid the request will not be processed and VAResultCode value is returned. Otherwise, the DMVA will continue to asynchronously validate the user license and initialize for the specified grammar model. The state will be set to Opening and VAResultCodeSuccess is returned. The DMVA will transition to the Opened state when it has license and grammar checks have completed successfully.
 
 The return value is one of the following:
 
 VAResultCodeSuccess - openVA has been initiated successfully and the Dragon Medical Virtual Assistant is in the Opening state.
 
 VAResultCodeNoSessionError - Request can not be processed because session is not initialised.
 
 VAResultCodeApplicationStateError - Application is in a state which does not allow an Open process to commence (either Opening or Closing).
 
 VAResultCodeBadRequestError - A bad request to server, like Model is null or an empty string, does not start with one of "Administrator", "Physician", or "Nurse".
