 @brief Initializes the Virtual Assistant. for the specified grammar model.
 
 Initializes the Virtual Assistant for the specified grammar model.  If the SpeechKit session is not open, the application type is not correct,  the DMVA state is not valid, or the parameter value is invalid the request will not be processed and an NUSAVirtualAssistantErrorCode value is returned.  Otherwise, the DMVA will continue to asynchronously validate the user license and initialize for the specified grammar model.  The state will be set to Opening and NUSAVirtualAssistantErrorCodeNoError   is returned. The DMVA will transition to the Opened state when it has asynchronous license and grammar checks have completed successfully.
 
 
 The return value is one of the following:
 
 NUSAVirtualAssistantErrorCodeNoError - openWithModel has been initiated successfully and the Dragon Medical Virtual Assistant is in the Opening state.
 
 NUSAVirtualAssistantErrorCodeApplicationStateError - Application is in a state which does not allow an Open process to commence (either Opening or Closing)

 Asynchronously sets the list of literal-value pairs for a dynamic concept.  The specified concept will be overwritten with the contents of the new list for the current user.

Note that while the command call returns a status synchronously, the upload and processing by the Virtual Assistant server is not.   The registered NUSAVirtualAssistantControllerDelegate's uploadConceptResult method will be called when the upload has occurred.  Items will continue to persist in the Virtual Assistant after it has closed and be available for the current user in subsequent sessions until clearUploadedValuesForConcept is called.  Therefore, if it is not expected that the items will be valid beyond the current session, it may be advisable  to call clearUploadedValuesForConcept before closing Virtual Assistant session.  If you need to update a concept  for immediate use, use setInlineValuesForConcept instead.   If the Virtual Assistant is not open, the request will not be processed and false is returned.
